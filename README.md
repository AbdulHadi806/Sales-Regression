## About Me:

I'm a young and passionate programmer with a love for continual growth and learning. Born on December 20, 2005, I'm deeply fascinated by the realms of machine learning and artificial intelligence, 
which is why I'm transitioning from fullstack web development to AI. As of February 9, 2024, I'm eager to witness the progress I'll make in the upcoming months.
